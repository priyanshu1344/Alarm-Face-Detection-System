# Project

This Python script utilizes various libraries to create a multifunctional voice-controlled system. It captures video from a camera, uses the DeepFace library 
for face recognition, and if a recognized face is detected, it processes voice commands received via a microphone. It can play music, provide the time, fetch 
information from Wikipedia, tell jokes, and run external Python scripts. The voice commands trigger actions such as opening different Python programs, and the
system's responses are spoken using text-to-speech. In case a recognized face is not found, it triggers an alarm. The script achieves this by continuously
listening for voice commands, recognizing speech, and executing actions based on the commands received, offering a versatile and interactive voice-controlled 
user experience.
